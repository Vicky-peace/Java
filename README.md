## 🎯 Introduction

This repository serves as a documentation hub for my **Java programming learning journey**. I'm starting with no prior experience in Java and working through core concepts, object-oriented programming, data structures, and eventually building full applications using frameworks like Spring Boot.

I aim to make this a valuable reference not only for myself but also for others who are just beginning their journey with Java.
